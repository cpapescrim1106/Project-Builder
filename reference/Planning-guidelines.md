# Programming Planning Guidelines

This document outlines a systematic approach to planning programming tasks before implementation, ensuring thorough preparation and efficient execution.

## üéØ Planning Principles

### 1. Optimize for AI Context Windows (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Chunk all work into small, independent steps** that fit within AI memory limits
- Each step should be completable in a single AI session
- Plan frequent checkpoints to save progress
- Avoid loading multiple large files simultaneously
- Structure code changes to minimize context needed

### 2. Understand Before You Code
- Read and comprehend requirements fully
- Identify all stakeholders and dependencies
- Clarify ambiguities before starting

### 3. Break Down Complex Tasks
- Decompose large features into smaller, testable units
- Create logical groupings of related functionality
- Define clear boundaries between components
- **Each unit should be small enough for AI to handle in one session**

### 4. Consider the Full Stack
- Frontend implications
- Backend requirements
- Database changes
- Infrastructure needs
- Security considerations

## üìã The Planning Process

**IMPORTANT**: Check off each item (‚ñ° ‚Üí ‚úì) as you complete it to track progress and ensure nothing is missed.

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis
```
‚ñ° Read the full requirement/ticket/PRD
‚ñ° Use sequentialthinking to decompose complex requirements into ordered tasks
‚ñ° Identify core functionality needed
‚ñ° List all user interactions
‚ñ° Note technical constraints
‚ñ° Identify dependencies on other systems
‚ñ° List questions that need clarification
```
‚úì Check off each item as completed

### Step 2: Technical Discovery
```
‚ñ° Use context7 for deep TypeScript-aware analysis of existing codebase structure
‚ñ° Identify similar patterns already implemented
‚ñ° Find reusable components/utilities
‚ñ° Check for existing libraries/packages
‚ñ° Use context7 to find latest component libraries and documentation
‚ñ° Use deepdev to understand cross-layer dependencies (DB ‚áÜ API ‚áÜ UI)
‚ñ° Review relevant documentation
‚ñ° Identify potential technical challenges
```
‚úì Check off each item as completed

### Step 3: Solution Design
```
‚ñ° Choose appropriate architecture pattern
‚ñ° Use deepdev to design data models/structures with full-stack context
‚ñ° Use sqlite for rapid schema prototyping and iteration
‚ñ° Plan API endpoints (if applicable) - use fetch to mock/test early
‚ñ° Sketch UI components (if applicable)
‚ñ° Define interfaces between components
‚ñ° Consider error handling strategies
‚ñ° Plan for edge cases
```

### Step 4: Task Breakdown
```
‚ñ° Use sequentialthinking to create ordered list of implementation tasks
‚ñ° CRITICAL: Ensure each task is small enough for one AI session
‚ñ° Plan checkpoint commits after each 2-3 tasks
‚ñ° Estimate time for each task
‚ñ° Identify dependencies between tasks
‚ñ° Define testable completion criteria with comprehensive puppeteer validation:
  - User interaction tests (click, fill, select, hover)
  - DOM state verification (puppeteer_evaluate)
  - Performance benchmarks (load times, render metrics)
  - Error scenario coverage
‚ñ° Note which tasks can be parallelized
‚ñ° Mark natural break points for context resets
```

### Step 5: Risk Assessment
```
‚ñ° Identify technical risks
‚ñ° Consider performance implications
‚ñ° Review security concerns
‚ñ° Plan mitigation strategies
‚ñ° Define fallback approaches
```

## üìä Estimation Guidelines

### Task Size Reference (AI-Optimized):
- **Trivial** (< 30 min): Config changes, simple UI tweaks - Perfect for AI
- **Small** (30 min - 1 hr): Single component changes - Ideal AI session size
- **Medium** (1-2 hr): Multi-component features - Split into 2-3 AI sessions
- **Large** (2-4 hr): Complex features - Must be broken down into smaller tasks
- **XL** (> 4 hr): Too large for AI - Break down before starting

### AI Session Guidelines:
- **Optimal session**: 30-45 minutes of focused work
- **Max session**: 1 hour before context reset needed
- **Files per session**: 3-5 files maximum
- **Changes per session**: 1-2 features or bug fixes

### Estimation Factors:
- **Complexity**: Algorithm difficulty, business logic
- **Integration**: Number of systems involved
- **Testing**: Test coverage required
- **Documentation**: Docs to write/update
- **Review**: Code review cycles expected

### Buffer Recommendations:
- Add 20% for unfamiliar code areas
- Add 30% for external dependencies
- Add 40% for concurrent team changes
- Add 50% for critical path items

   // Check console errors
   puppeteer_evaluate({ script: "window.errors || []" })
   
   // Measure performance
   puppeteer_evaluate({ 
     script: "performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0].loadEventEnd" 
   })
   ```

7. **puppeteer_screenshot** - Visual validation and regression testing

puppeteer_navigate({ url: "https://app.example.com" })

// 2. Verify Initial State
puppeteer_evaluate({ 
  script: "document.readyState === 'complete'" 
})

// 3. Test User Login Flow
puppeteer_fill({ selector: "#email", value: "test@example.com" })
puppeteer_fill({ selector: "#password", value: "password123" })
puppeteer_click({ selector: "#login-button" })

// 4. Validate Login Success
puppeteer_evaluate({ 
  script: "window.location.pathname === '/dashboard'" 
})

// 5. Test Interactive Features
puppeteer_hover({ selector: ".user-menu" })

// 6. Verify Data Loading
puppeteer_evaluate({ 
  script: "document.querySelectorAll('.data-row').length > 0" 
})

// 7. Test Error Handling
puppeteer_click({ selector: ".invalid-action" })
puppeteer_evaluate({ 
  script: "document.querySelector('.error-message')?.textContent" 
})

// 8. Performance Validation
puppeteer_evaluate({
  script: `
    const metrics = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
    return {
      pageLoadTime: metrics.loadEventEnd - metrics.fetchStart,
      domReady: metrics.domContentLoadedEventEnd
    }
  `
})

// 9. Visual Documentation
puppeteer_screenshot({ name: "test-complete", selector: "body" })
```

##### Testing Best Practices:

1. **Always validate functionality, not just visuals**
   - Use `puppeteer_evaluate` to check DOM state
   - Verify JavaScript execution and console errors
   - Test API responses and data loading

2. **Test user journeys end-to-end**
   - Chain multiple actions to simulate real workflows
   - Test error paths and edge cases
   - Validate state persistence across pages

3. **Performance testing is crucial**
   - Measure page load times
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Monitor console errors and warnings

4. **Responsive testing**
   - Test different viewport sizes
   - Validate mobile interactions
   - Check touch events and gestures

5. **Accessibility validation**
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Verify ARIA attributes
   - Check focus management

#### Isolated Environment Testing
When planning tests, especially for AI-generated code, consider using Docker for isolated testing environments if you need to:
- Test without affecting your local setup
- Verify code works in clean environments
- Test across different versions/platforms
- Automatic cleanup with `--rm` flag

Example: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app node:18 npm test`

Remember: Good planning is an investment that pays dividends in faster implementation, fewer bugs, and better code quality. The goal is to think through problems before they become expensive to fix.
